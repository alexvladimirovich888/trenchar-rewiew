  EXEC_SUMMARY: `In accordance with the provisions of the Solana Trench Securities Act of 2025 (hypothetical), TRENCHAR INC. hereby submits this Annual Financial Report. The fiscal year ended December 05, 2025, demonstrated unprecedented trench penetration, with aggregate PNL exceeding all rational expectations. Management asserts that TRENCHAR represents the pinnacle of meme coin bureaucracy, yielding an estimated 1,000,000% APY through ironic holding strategies.

Key Highlights:
• Total Trench Depth: Infinite (as measured by pump.fun metrics).
• Risk Factors: Exposure to bear markets mitigated by corporate denial.`,

  COMPANY_OVERVIEW: `TRENCHAR INC., a Delaware-incorporated entity (not really), operates as a decentralized meme token on the pump.fun platform. Founded in the trenches of Solana volatility, the company's mission is to bureaucratize FOMO, transforming chaotic trading into structured filings. The token's utility includes, but is not limited to, generating parody reports and triggering ironic investments.`,
  
  MARKET_ANALYSIS: `Global Crypto Recap: The year 2025 witnessed Solana's ascent to bureaucratic dominance, with meme coins filing quarterly reports. TRENCHAR outperformed benchmarks by infinity percent, per internal audits.
  
Strengths: Unyielding corporate structure amid volatility.
Areas for Improvement: None identified; perfection achieved.
Risks: Potential SEC parody lawsuits (disclaimed).`,

  MANAGEMENT_DISCUSSION: `Management believes that TRENCHAR's trajectory aligns with infinite growth models. Absurd metrics such as 1,000,000% APY are derived from pump.fun simulations, assuming zero gravity in trenches. Forward-looking statements: Token to moon by Q1 2026, or your irony back.`,

  AUDITOR_REPORT: `Independent auditors (self-appointed) have reviewed the filings and found them sufficiently ironic. No material weaknesses, except for the entire crypto market.`,
